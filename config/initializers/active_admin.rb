  # == Site Title
  #
  # Set the title that is displayed on the main layout
  # for each of the active admin pages.
  #
  config.site_title = "BARZiT"
  config.site_title_link = :root
  
  # == Default Namespace
  #
  # Set the default namespace each administration resource
  # will be added to. 
  #
  # eg: 
  #   config.default_namespace = :hello_world
  #
  # This will create resources in the HelloWorld module and
  # will namespace routes to /hello_world/*
  #
  # To set no namespace by default, use:
  # config.default_namespace = false
  config.default_namespace = false


  # == User Authentication
  #
  # Active Admin will automatically call an authentication 
  # method in a before filter of all controller actions to 
  # ensure that there is a currently logged in admin user.
  #
  # This setting changes the method which Active Admin calls
  # within the controller.
  config.authentication_method = :authenticate_user! # Disabled for demo


  # == Current User
  #
  # Active Admin will associate actions with the current
  # user performing them.
  #
  # This setting changes the method which Active Admin calls
  # to return the currently logged in user.
  config.current_user_method = :current_user # Disabled for demo
  

  # == Admin Notes
  # 
  # Admin notes allow you to add notes to any model
  #
  # Admin notes are enabled by default, but can be disabled
  # by uncommenting this line:
  #
  # config.admin_notes = true

  # == Logging Out
  #
  # Active Admin displays a logout link on each screen. These
  # settings configure the location and method used for the link.
  #
  # This setting changes the path where the link points to. If it's
  # a string, the strings is used as the path. If it's a Symbol, we
  # will call the method to return the path.
  #
  # Default:
  config.logout_link_path = :destroy_user_session_path

  # This setting changes the http method used when rendering the
  # link. For example :get, :delete, :put, etc..
  #
  # Default:
  # config.logout_link_method = :get


  # == Admin Comments
  #
  # Admin comments allow you to add comments to any model for admin use.
  # Admin comments are enabled by default.
  #
  # Default:
  # config.allow_comments = true
  #
  # You can turn them on and off for any given namespace by using a
  # namespace config block.
  #
  # Eg:
  #   config.namespace :without_comments do |without_comments|
  #     without_comments.allow_comments = false
  #   end


  # == Controller Filters
  #
  # You can add before, after and around filters to all of your
  # Active Admin resources from here.
  #
  # config.before_filter :do_something_awesome


  # == Register Stylesheets & Javascripts
  #
  # We recomend using the built in Active Admin layout and loading
  # up your own stylesheets / javascripts to customize the look
  # and feel.
  #
  # To load a stylesheet:
  config.register_stylesheet 'admin.css'
  #
  # To load a javascript file:
  config.register_javascript 'application.js'
